## ⚠️ Required Actions Before Production

### 1. Remove Test Endpoints
The following test endpoints have been removed/secured for production:

#### In `server.js`:
- [x] Removed: `app.use('/test', testLocationRoutes);`
- [x] Removed: `app.get('/api/test-location/:ip', ...)`
- [x] Removed: `app.get('/api/test-user-locations/:userId', ...)`
- [x] Added conditional loading for development only

#### Test Route Files:
- [x] Secured: Test endpoints now only load in development mode
- [x] Removed: Test endpoints from Postman collection
- [x] Ensured: No unauthenticated test endpoints in production

### 2. Environment Configuration

#### Required Environment Variables:
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Your production Firebase project
- [ ] `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` - Production Firebase service account key
- [ ] `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` - Production Firebase service account email
- [ ] `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Production Google Maps API key (if using location services)
- [ ] `REDIS_HOST`, `REDIS_PORT`, `REDIS_PASSWORD` - If using Redis in production
- [ ] All email service credentials for production

#### Cache Configuration:
- [ ] Review cache TTL settings for production workload
- [ ] Configure appropriate cache size limits
- [ ] Set up monitoring for cache performance

### 3. Security Hardening

#### Authentication:
- [ ] Verify all enterprise endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Ensure proper user/enterprise authorization
- [ ] Remove any test/debug endpoints without auth

#### CORS Configuration:
- [x] Updated CORS to be production-ready
- [x] Configured conditional origins based on NODE_ENV
- [x] Removed wildcard (`*`) origin for production
- [x] Set up proper allowed origins configuration

#### Rate Limiting:
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for cache-intensive endpoints
- [ ] Set appropriate limits for enterprise endpoints
- [ ] Monitor for abuse patterns

### 4. Monitoring & Logging

#### Cache Monitoring:
- [ ] Set up alerts for cache hit ratio drops
- [ ] Monitor cache memory usage
- [ ] Track cache invalidation patterns

#### Performance Monitoring:
- [ ] Monitor response times for cache miss scenarios
- [ ] Set up alerts for slow queries (>5 seconds)
- [ ] Track concurrent request patterns

#### Error Monitoring:
- [ ] Set up error tracking for cache failures
- [ ] Monitor Firestore query failures
- [ ] Track cache invalidation errors

### 5. Database Optimization

#### Firestore Indexes:
- [ ] Verify all required composite indexes are created
- [ ] Test query performance with production data volume
- [ ] Monitor Firestore read/write costs

#### Query Optimization:
- [ ] Review and optimize expensive aggregation queries
- [ ] Implement pagination for large result sets
- [ ] Consider data denormalization for frequently accessed data

### 6. Backup & Recovery

#### Data Backup:
- [ ] Ensure Firestore backup strategy is in place
- [ ] Test cache reconstruction procedures
- [ ] Document recovery procedures

#### Cache Recovery:
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation when cache is cold
- [ ] Test cache warming procedures
- [ ] Document cache management procedures

### 7. Documentation Updates

#### API Documentation:
- [ ] Update API documentation with production URLs
- [ ] Remove test endpoint documentation
- [ ] Document rate limits and usage guidelines

#### Operational Documentation:
- [ ] Cache management procedures
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting setup
- [ ] Troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Performance tuning guidelines

## 🚀 Production Deployment Steps

### Pre-Deployment:
1. [ ] Complete all items in "Required Actions" section
2. [ ] Run full test suite against staging environment
3. [ ] Verify all environment variables are set
4. [ ] Test cache warming with production data volume

### Deployment:
1. [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
2. [ ] Run smoke tests on staging
3. [ ] Verify cache performance on staging
4. [ ] Deploy to production
5. [ ] Warm caches for active enterprises
6. [ ] Monitor initial performance

### Post-Deployment:
1. [ ] Monitor cache hit ratios
2. [ ] Verify performance improvements
3. [ ] Check error rates and response times
4. [ ] Validate cache invalidation is working
5. [ ] Monitor memory usage patterns

## 📊 Success Metrics

After production deployment, verify:
- [ ] Cache hit ratio > 80% for active enterprises
- [ ] Response time improvement of 400x+ for cached requests
- [ ] No significant increase in error rates
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] Proper cache invalidation on data changes

## 🆘 Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. [ ] Document rollback procedure
2. [ ] Prepare to disable caching while keeping core functionality
3. [ ] Have procedure to clear problematic cache entries
4. [ ] Monitor system health after rollback

## Final Sign-off

- [ ] Development team approval
- [ ] Security team approval (if applicable)
- [ ] Operations team approval
- [ ] Performance testing completed
- [ ] All test endpoints removed
- [ ] Production environment configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
